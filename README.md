# Bunkchat

# Info
Android app that enables people to chat by using only their built-in Wi-Fi.
Works on all devices that are API 15 (Tested) or above.
One phone needs to be the host, and all the others will be clients.
Everyone is able to chat with one another.

# Feature Status
Most of the features have been implemented.

# Issues
Reliability is the biggest issue when using this app. Like Multiple Hosts using the same identification. Works sometimes. Not Recommended.
Orientation changes, Connection changes can cause the app to not work properly or even shut down.
In the best case, if the users are perfect in executing host-server relationship, it works as intended.

# Current Status
Project on hold.
